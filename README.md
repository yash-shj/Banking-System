# Banking-System
A simple C++ program simulating basic banking operations.

### Overview
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming and file handling in C++. It allows users to perform banking operations such as opening accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, checking balances, and closing accounts.

### Concepts Implemented
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Used to model bank accounts and operations through classes like `Account` and `Bank`, encapsulating data and functionality.
- **File Handling:** Implemented persistent storage of account data in `bankRecords.txt`, ensuring data retention between program executions.
- **Exception Handling:** Custom exceptions such as `InsufficientFunds` and `AccountNotFound` manage errors, enhancing error handling and program reliability.
- **User Interaction:** Provided a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with banking operations efficiently.

### Usage
1. Compile `main.cpp`.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow prompts to perform banking operations.
